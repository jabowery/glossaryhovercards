  <dl>
    <dt class="term">Discriminator</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>A *discriminator* $x$ is a structural device that fixes a notion of
**Relative Identity** and thereby a **World**$(x)$: for any $y,z$,
the statement $x(y=z)$ is decided solely by how $y,z$ appear in the
**Structure Tables** and **Count Tables** that $x$ uses. In GA, a
discriminator is implemented as a chosen family of **Selections** and
**Linkings** (projection operators) acting on multivectors.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">World of a Discriminator</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>The *world* of a **Discriminator** $x$ is the class of **Things**
that $x$ can distinguish from itself by some pattern in its **Structure
Tables**: 
$$
{World}(x) = \{ t : x(t=x)\},
$$
where $x(t=x)$ is **Relative Identity**. In GA, ${World}(x)$ is the
set of multivectors not identified with the ``state'' of $x$ under the
projections determined by $x$.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Thing</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>A *thing* $t$ is any entity that lies in the **World** of at least one
**Discriminator**: there exist $x,y$ with $x(t=y)$ under
**Relative Identity**. Thus, ``thinghood'' is defined by participation in
some pattern of discrimination. In GA, a thing is any multivector that survives
non-trivial **Selection** for some discriminator.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Relative Identity</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>*Relative identity* is the identity statement read ``$y$ and $z$ are the
same *for* discriminator $x$''. Formally, $x(y=z)$ holds iff, in all
**Structure Tables** and **Count Tables** used by $x$, the rows and
columns containing $y$ and $z$ are interchangeable under the same
**Linkings** and **Selections**. In GA, $x(y=z)$ means that the
projection operators implementing $x$ send $y$ and $z$ to the same multivector.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Quine Identity</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>Given a single binary relation $R$ whose extension is encoded in a
**Structure Table**, the *Quine identity* $Q_R$ is the **Relative
Identity** induced solely by the way elements appear in the rows and columns of
that table. Concretely, $Q_R(x=y)$ holds iff $x$ and $y$ occur in exactly the
same positions within the **Structure Table** (same incident rows and
columns) and remain interchangeable under all **Selections** and
**Linkings** generated from $R$. In GA, $Q_R$ identifies terms whose
associated $R$-operators act identically on all multivectors.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Intrinsic Identity (of a predicate / system)</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>The *intrinsic identity* of a primitive predicate (or of an axiom system)
is the finest **Relative Identity** obtained by closing the relevant Quine
identities $Q_R$ under all **Linkings**, **Selections** and
**Structural Evolution Operators** that are allowed by the system. Two
**Things** are intrinsically identical if every such structurally permitted
transformation preserves $Q_R(x=y)$ for all predicates $R$ in the language. In
GA, intrinsic identity is the equivalence of terms generated by all definable
operators in the chosen model.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Structure Table</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>A *structure table* is a **Count Table** whose range has been
canonically indexed so that only structural relations between rows and columns
matter. It is the basic carrier of structure on which **Selections**,
**Linkings**, **Hidings**, and **Structural Evolution Operators**
act. In GA, a structure table corresponds to a fixed choice of basis for
multivectors representing the same structural pattern.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Count Table</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>A *count table* is an extension represented as rows, columns, and integer
counts (possibly **Negative Counts**), so that multiple identical
relationships are combined into a single row with a total count. Count tables
support **Empty Pairs**, **Interference**, and the normalization to
**Density Count Matrices**. In GA, a count table is a multivector whose
coefficients are these integer counts.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Density Count Matrix</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>A *density count matrix* is a count matrix derived from a **Count
Table** by appropriate normalization (typically by total non-empty count), so
that it can be used to assign ``structural probabilities'' to link values. It is
the object that evolves under **Structural Evolution Operators** and is
constrained by **Structural Unitarity** and **Past--Future
Symmetry**. In GA, it is the density operator built from multivectors whose
coefficients come from count tables.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Negative Count</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>A *negative count* is an entry $-n$ in a **Count Table**, understood
only as part of a pattern of **Empty Pairs** and **Interference**.
Negative counts cannot appear in isolation in a **Proper** structure, but
only in combinations that can be cancelled or transformed by
**Structural Evolution Operators**. In GA, a negative count is a negative
coefficient on a blade in the multivector.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Empty Pair</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>An *empty pair* is a pair of rows in a **Count Table** with counts
$n$ and $-n$ that together form a net-zero contribution to all
**Selections**, **Linkings**, and **Shape**. A finite union of
empty pairs that yields net zero counts on all rows is an *empty part*.
Adding an empty part to any structure does not change its **Relative
Identities**, **Worlds**, or **Shape**. In GA, an empty part is a
multivector that is identically zero, built from terms $B + (-B)$.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Interference</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>*Interference* is the phenomenon that occurs when **Negative Counts**
and positive counts in a **Count Table** combine into **Empty
Pairs**, thereby changing the pattern of non-empty rows under
**Selections** and **Linkings** without altering **Shape**. In
GA, interference is just addition of multivectors in which some blades cancel.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Shape</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>The *shape* of a **Structure Table** is the class of all tables that
can be obtained from it by permutations of rows, columns, and value indices
that preserve the pattern of **Count Tables**, **Empty Parts**,
**Relative Identities**, and **Relation-numbers**. Thus, shape is
the global structural invariant of a table under all allowed relabelings. In
GA, shape is the orbit of a multivector under the automorphism group that
preserves all structural operations. (In Principia Mathematica this was *incorrectly* called **Relation Number** which is, in geometric analogy, congruence rather than mere similarity of shapes.).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Relation-number</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>The *relation-number* of a part of a **Structure Table** is the
number of distinct occurrences of that part in the same **Shape** when we
apply all permutations that preserve **Relative Identity** and the
**Count Table** structure. It measures structured recurrence of parts
within a shape. In GA, a relation-number is the size of the orbit of a
sub-multivector under the automorphisms that fix the ambient shape.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Selection</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>A *selection* is an operation that takes a **Structure Table** and
designates some of its rows and columns as *foreground*, leaving the rest
as *background*. Selections generate the frames of a **Structural
Time** sequence and determine which parts of a structure a **Discriminator**
actually uses to fix **Relative Identity**. In GA, selections are
projectors onto subspaces spanned by chosen blades.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Linking</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>*Linking* is the operation that imposes equality conditions between
columns (or rows) of one or more **Structure Tables**, by deleting all
rows that violate these equalities and then re-indexing the resulting
**Count Table**. Linking thus creates joint structures and defines the
``present'' interface between past and future in **Structural Time**. In
GA, linking is projection onto the subspace where linked indices coincide.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Hiding</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>*Hiding* is the operation that removes columns or rows that have been used
in **Linking** but are no longer of interest to a given
**Discriminator**. Hiding preserves **Relative Identity** on the
remaining variables while marginalizing out the hidden ones, within the same
**Shape**. In GA, hiding corresponds to partial trace or projection that
forgets certain indices.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Structural Time</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>*Structural time* is the ordering of **Selections**, **Linkings**
and **Hidings** applied to **Structure Tables** and **Density
Count Matrices**, rather than an external parameter. A *dynamic sequence*
is a finite or infinite chain of such operations, possibly governed by a
**Structural Evolution Operator**. In GA, structural time is encoded by
the composition order of projectors and linear operators on multivectors.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Structural Evolution Operator</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>A *structural evolution operator* $T$ is a map that sends **Structure
Tables** and their corresponding **Density Count Matrices** to new ones in a
way that respects **Shape**, **Relative Identity**, and the
**Empty Part** bookkeeping. When $T$ is invertible and satisfies
**Structural Unitarity**, it generates reversible **Structural Time**.
In GA, $T$ is a linear operator (often unitary) acting on the space of
multivectors and their density operators.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Structural Unitarity</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>A *structurally unitary* evolution is one in which a **Structural
Evolution Operator** $T$ preserves the total ``count-mass'' and the normalization
of **Density Count Matrices**, i.e.\ it preserves all structural
probabilities. Structural unitarity thus ties the reversible part of
**Structural Time** to invariants of **Shape** and **Relative
Identity**. In GA, structural unitarity is realized by norm-preserving linear
operators (unitary or orthogonal) on the state space.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt class="term">Past--Future Symmetry</dt>
    <dd class="definition">
      <p>A system has *past--future symmetry* when its **Structural Time**
evolution admits a **Structural Evolution Operator** $T$ and an inverse
$T^{-1}$ such that the corresponding **Density Count Matrices** and
**Relative Identities** are invariant under reversing the order of
applications of $T$ (modulo **Empty Parts**). In this domain, quantum-like
**Interference** and **Structural Unitarity** dominate. In GA, this
is realized when the dynamics is given by a unitary family $T(t)$ and its
adjoint $T(t)^{-1}$, with symmetry under time reversal.</p>
